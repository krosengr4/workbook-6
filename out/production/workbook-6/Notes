Multiple Inheritance
- Java does not allow multiple inheritance
- When a child class extends two parent classes
- This causes problems when trying to use a method that is found in both parents classes

- Interfaces are used to allow for multiple inheritance

Interface:
- All methods are abstract
- All methods must be public
- Similar to extending an abstract class
- A class MUST override all the methods defined in the interface
- Interfaces are collections of abstract methods
- Interfaces do not have data members, and can't be instantiated
